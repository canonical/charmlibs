`charmlibs` is the home of Canonical's charm libraries.

This site hosts reference documentation for {ref}`charmlibs<reference-charmlibs>` and {ref}`charmlibs.interfaces<reference-charmlibs-interfaces>` packages, as well as for {ref}`interfaces<reference-interfaces>`.
There's are also pages listing {ref}`general charm libraries<general-libs-listing>` and {ref}`charm interface libraries<interface-libs-listing>`, including `charmlibs` packages, legacy Charmhub-hosted libs, and everything in-between, where you can find out more about which libraries are recommended and where to get them.

To get started contributing your own library to the `charmlibs` monorepo, check out {ref}`the tutorial<tutorial>`.

You can also read our {ref}`guidance on distributing charm libraries<how-to-python-package>`.

If you're new to charms, see {ref}`Juju | Charm <juju:charm>`.
