r""":mod:`pathlib`-like interface for local and :class:`ops.Container` filesystem paths.

:class:`ContainerPath` implements a ``pathlib.Path`` style interface for path operations on
a Juju charm's workload container.
This interface is defined in :class:`PathProtocol`, which defines a subset of ``pathlib.Path``
methods that Pebble supports. The file creation methods are extended with ownership
and permissions arguments, as Pebble sets these on file creation.
:class:`LocalPath` is a subclass of ``pathlib.Path`` that provides these extended method
signatures for local filesystem operations.

.. tip::
    When writing substrate-agnostic code, use :class:`PathProtocol` in your type annotations
    for accurate type checking and useful autocompletions.
    Calling code can then supply a :class:`ContainerPath` or :class:`LocalPath` as needed.

.. warning::
    :class:`ContainerPath` may raise a :class:`PebbleConnectionError` if the workload container is
    unreachable. Subtrate-agnostic code may choose to be aware of this, or may leave handling this
    up to substrate-aware calling code, documenting this if so.

This library also provides the following functions:

- :func:`ensure_contents` operates on a :class:`ContainerPath` or any local filesystem :class:`str`
  or :class:`os.PathLike` object, and ensures that the requested contents are available at that
  path, writing and setting ownership and permissions as needed.

.. note::
    ``StrPathLike`` is a type alias for :class:`str` | :class:`os.PathLike`\[:class:`str`].
    This allows path arguments to be specified as strings or as path-like objects, such as
    :class:`pathlib.PurePath`. :class:`ContainerPath` is **not** :class:`os.PathLike`.

The constants defining the default file and directory permissions are not exported by this package,
but are documented here to explain the otherwise opaque numbers appearing as default arguments.
