# charmlibs

This package should not be installed - it exists solely to reserve the `charmlibs` namespace.

This namespace is for packages designed to be used by [Juju](https://juju.is/) [charms](https://juju.is/charms-architecture).

See the Juju documentation to [get started with charm development](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/juju/3.6/howto/manage-charms/#build-a-charm), and visit the [charmlibs documentation site](https://canonical-charmlibs.readthedocs-hosted.com/) for more information about charm libraries. You can also read more about [distributing your own charm library as a Python package](https://canonical-charmlibs.readthedocs-hosted.com/how-to/python-package/#how-to-python-package).
